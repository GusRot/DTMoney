### Development

In development, several technical tools were used: Function Components as standard, Context API to control transactions, API get/post in the Transactions table (Simulated a Fake API with MirageJS), with the use of Storage to save changes when reloading the page. All this with Typescript for greater control over the variables in the application. 
Also developed a mobile apk with React Native.
